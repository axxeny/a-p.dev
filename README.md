## A warm welcome to Arseniy Poroshin's page 💙

I am a software engineer, a finance hobbyist and a very curious person.

## What do you do professionally?

- 🐍 I am a polyglot engineer, currently mostly specialized on Python.
- 📈 I have completed many projects in backend engineering and software infrastructure.
- 👀 I’m interested in finance, and the very best engineering practices.
- 🌱 I learn whatever I need for the interesting tasks.

## What is it that you care about?

- 🧑‍🌾 I would love our society to put more into longevity research. No, overpopulation is a separate issue. No, if you are scared of boredom—it is a separate issue as well. Let us defeat aging! More info: https://youtu.be/fX9P1xuIJGg
- 🎲 I love the probability theory. For example, when considering a distribution of outcomes, pay attention to how catastrophic the worst cases are. Here is a little primer on how to not over-bet on seemingly positive expected return: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion
- 📈 I am a trading & finance hobbyist. Former Quantitative analysis student at CMF: https://iqf.hse.ru/cmf .
- あ I love learning languages. Learning new sounds, new alphabets, and new ways of how grammar can work is so much fun to me!
- 🏞 I love trekking. What could be better than a lovely day hike at 2,000 m high in Armenia?
- 🕊 I am a fan of peace and liberty. I have seen the neighbours enjoying living with each other many times. Let us nourish love to each other!
