## A warm welcome to Arseniy Poroshin's page 💙

I'd describe myself as a Eurorussian software engineer with a finance spin, striving to grow and to live a healthy and curious life.

### What do you do professionally?

- 💻 I construct software, seeing it from three viewpoints:
- 📈 I supplement quants with tech expertise to get up and running. That is the data processing viewpoint.
- 🏗️ I helped building infrastructure for reliable, scalable, maintainable distributed systems. That is the SRE and system design viewpoint.
- 👾 I enjoy learning & teaching the basics of game development in my spare time. That is the viewpoint of simplicity vs abstraction tradeoff. What is the ideal mixture between procedural data-oriented and hierarchical object-oriented? Do we need encapsulation?
- 🐍 Mostly I write in Python with scientific batteries.
- 🤸🏻‍♂️ I always check on and appreciate the concepts underpinning other languages like C, C++, Go, Rust, Haskell, as well as many others.

### What is it that you care about?

- 🧑‍🌾 I would love our society to put more into the research for defeating human ageing. No, it hardly affects overpopulation. No, boredom is a separate issue as well. Let us defeat aging! [A good summarizing talk by Andrew Steele](https://youtu.be/fX9P1xuIJGg)
- 🎲 I love the probability theory. For example, when considering a distribution of outcomes, pay attention to how catastrophic the worst cases are. Here is a little primer on how to not over-bet on a seemingly positive expected return: [the Kelly criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion)
- 📈 I am a trading & finance hobbyist. A Quantitative analysis alumnus at [CMF](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cmf-ynvrsty/).
- あ I love learning languages. Learning new sounds, new alphabets, and new ways of how grammar can work is so much fun to me!
- 🏞 I love hiking. What could be better than a lovely journey passing by a mountain river at a 2,000 m or a 7,000 ft altitude in warm weather?
- 🚴‍♂️ Let our towns embrace / Cycling, trams and trains / Making city space / A lovely lively place!
- 🕊 I am a fan of peace and liberty. Respect our neighbours' freedoms. Recognize what we did wrong. Reconcile to make future right. Repair our shattered kindness.
