## A warm welcome to Arseniy Poroshin's page 💙

I am a software engineer, a finance hobbyist and a very curious person.

## What do you do professionally?

- 🐍 I am a polyglot engineer, currently mostly specialized on Python.
- 📈 I have completed many projects in backend engineering and software infrastructure.
- 👀 I’m interested in finance, and the very best engineering practices.
- 🌱 I learn whatever I need for the interesting tasks.

## What is it that you care about?

- 🧑‍🌾 I would love our society to put more into longevity research. No, it hardly affects overpopulation. No, boredom is a separate issue as well. Let us defeat aging! [More info by Andrew Steele](https://youtu.be/fX9P1xuIJGg)
- 🎲 I love the probability theory. For example, when considering a distribution of outcomes, pay attention to how catastrophic the worst cases are. Here is a little primer on how to not over-bet on seemingly positive expected return: [the Kelly criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion)
- 📈 I am a trading & finance hobbyist. Former Quantitative analysis student at [CMF](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cmf-ynvrsty/).
- あ I love learning languages. Learning new sounds, new alphabets, and new ways of how grammar can work is so much fun to me!
- 🏞 I love hiking. What could be better than a lovely journey passing by a mountain river at a 2,000 m altitude in Armenia?
- 🕊 I am a fan of peace and liberty. Many times have I seen the neighbours enjoying living together. Let us nourish love to each other!
